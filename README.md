This is the project I have done using bootstrap to create a webpage. I have watched an instructor use bootstrap and followed along using my own creative liberty. 

It is made using primarily HTML. The css and javascript on the site is through bootstrap. 

This site was solely made for gaining experience with bootsrap and has no real world purpose or value.
